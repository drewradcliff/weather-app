# React Interview Project
This is a small project for a react interview. This project will test your ability to create something from the ground up and will also take a look at your project structure skills, design skills, and API implementation.

## Goal
Display the weather and current conditions along with some graphical representation of the weather for the user's current location.

## UX/UI
Up to you, but ideally some icons that illustrate the current weather of the user's current location. You could implement a search input for user location for some bonus points.

## Retrieving data
You will need to retrieve weather information from the weather API supplied to you. The key will have been communicated to you via an external communication.

API Documentation can be found here: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/#

## Bootstrapping the project
Up to you, we recommend [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Submitting the solution
Copy this repository to a repository on your name and add the solution there. It should be clear how to build and run the project locally.

## Bonus (don't need to be in the below specific order)
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
* Make use of hooks
* Adding types with Flow or Typescript
* Adding a spinner when information is loading (up to you on what kind of spinner to implement, but we really like [lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/))
	* Lottie is expensive on the front-end, but if implemented properly it can be cost effective.
* Deal with errors coming from the backend
* Having a nice UI using a components library
	* Here are some of our favorites:
		* [Styled Components](http://styled-components.com/)
		* [Styled Bootstrap Grid](https://github.com/dragma/styled-bootstrap-grid)
		* [Polished](https://polished.js.org/)
		* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
* Proper project structure and separation of application folders & files.
* Adding state management
* Adding light/dark modes.
* Show common tools used for you daily development environment (linters, code formatter, git workflow, docker and so on)
* Deploy the project somewhere (Heroku is a great one!)
